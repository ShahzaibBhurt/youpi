Privacy Policy, including the PetThoughts iOS app (collectively, the “<span class="bold">Services</span>”). This privacy policy
(the “<span class="bold">Privacy Policy</span>”) explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from users
of the Services (“<span class="bold">Users</span>”). By using the Services, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of

      <p><span class="bold">Communications.</span> If you contact us directly, we may receive additional personal information about
you. For example, when you contact us for support, we will receive your username, phone number,
