          <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Youpi Inc. (“<span class="bold">Youpi</span>,” “<span class="bold">we</span>,” or “<span class="bold">us</span>”) and our website at <a href="https://youpi.camera/" target="_blank">https://youpi.camera/</a>, along with our related websites,
            networks, applications, mobile applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, the “<span class="bold">Service</span>”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding
            contract between you and Youpi regarding your use of the Service.</p>
           <p class="bold">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY.</p>
           <p><span class="bold">BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE</span>, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY,
             THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING YOUPI’S PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THESE “<span class="bold">TERMS</span>”). IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF
             THE SERVICE, AND YOUPI’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY YOUPI AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p>
<!--Arbitration Notice-->
          <p><span class="bold">ARBITRATION NOTICE.</span> Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 16, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU
            AND YOUPI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that
            may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury (See Section 16).</p>

          <li><span class="bold">Youpi Service Overview</span>. Youpi provides a mobile application that enhances users’ own video recordings with animated bubbles, rich fonts and user generated sound effects. Users can post their videos for other users to browse or build a timeline of
            memories with their videos. Users can connect with one another with mutual consent based on the mutual interests shared in videos posted to the Youpi Service.</li>
        <!--2-->

            from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and

          <li><span class="bold">Accounts and Registration</span>. To acc
            ess most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, phone number, or other contact information. You agree that the information you
            provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you may be asked to provide a password or other security credentials. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and security
            credentials, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at help@youpi.camera.</li>

          <li><span class="bold">Licenses</span></li>
            <ol class="number2">
              <li>4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Limited License</span>. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Youpi grants you, solely for your personal, non-commercial use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to:
                (a) install and use one object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Service obtained from a legitimate marketplace (whether installed by you or pre-installed on your mobile device by the device manufacturer) on a mobile device that you own or control;
                and (b) access and use the Service. </li>
              <li>4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">License Restrictions</span>. Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not: (a) reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform the Service; (b) make modifications to the Service;
                or (c) interfere with or circumvent any feature of the Service, including any security or access control mechanism. If you are prohibited under applicable law from using the Service, you may not use it.</li>
              <li>4.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Feedback</span>. If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the Service (“Feedback”), then you hereby grant Youpi an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid,
                royalty-free right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the Service and create other products and services.</li>
            </ol>
        <!--5-->
          <li><span class="bold">Ownership; Proprietary Rights</span>. The Service is owned and operated by Youpi. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the
            Service (“<span class="bold">Materials</span>”) provided by Youpi are protected by intellectual property and other laws. All Materials included in the Service are the property of Youpi or its third party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by Youpi, you may not make use of the Materials.
            Youpi reserves all rights to the Materials not granted expressly in these Terms.</li>
        <!--6-->
          <li><span class="bold">Third Party Terms</span></li>
            <ol class="number2" type="1">
              <li>6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Third Party Services and Linked Websites</span>. Youpi may provide tools through the Service that enable you to export information, including User Content (defined below), to third party services, including through features that allow you to link your account on
                Youpi with an account on the third party service, such as Snapchat, Instagram, or TikTok, or through our implementation of third party buttons (such as “like” or “share” buttons). By using one of these tools, you agree that Youpi may transfer that information to the applicable third party
                service. Third party services are not under Youpi’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Youpi is not responsible for any third party service’s use of your exported information. The Service may also contain links to third party websites. Linked websites are not under Youpi’s
                control, and Youpi is not responsible for their content.</li>
              <li>6.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Third Party Components</span>. The Service may include or incorporate third party software components that are generally available free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute those components (“<span class="bold">Third Party Components</span>”).
                Although the Service is provided to you subject to these Terms, nothing in these Terms prevents, restricts, or is intended to prevent or restrict you from obtaining Third Party Components under the applicable third party licenses or to limit your use of Third Party Components under those third party licenses. For information
                about Third Party Components used in our Services visit our <a href="credits.html" target="_blank">Credits Page</a> (available at <a href="credits.html" target="_blank">https://youpi.camera/credits.html</a>).</li>

          <li><span class="bold">User Content</span></li>
            <ol class="number2" type="1">
              <li>7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">User Content Generally</span>. Certain features of the Service may permit users to submit, upload, publish, broadcast, or otherwise transmit (“<span class="bold">Post</span>”) content to the Service, including messages, reviews, photos, video, images, folders, data, text, and any other works of
                authorship or other works (“<span class="bold">User Content</span>”). You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you Post to the Service. In the event that you delete your User Content from the Service, Youpi may, but is not obligated to retain copies of your deleted User
                Content. Youpi may use incidental copies of Your Content retained on Youpi’s systems for internal business purposes.</li>
              <li>7.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Limited License Grant to Youpi of Your Private Content</span>. By Posting User Content to a private area of the Service (e.g., creating, but not sharing, a timeline), you grant Youpi a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license to host, store, transfer, display, perform,
                reproduce, and modify such User Content for the full period of time that you maintain your account on the Services, to enable your use of the intended features and functionality of the Service with respect to that User Content, or to resolve any issues that may arise with the Services. </li>
              <li>7.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Limited License Grant to Youpi of Your Public Content</span>. By Posting User Content to or via a public area Service (e.g., sharing a timeline or posting a video), you grant Youpi a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense
                through multiple tiers) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels now known or hereafter developed.
                All of the rights you grant in these Terms are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of external services will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content Posted or otherwise used on external services via the Service. You agree to pay all monies owing
                to any person resulting from Posting your User Content, including from Youpi’s exercise of the license set forth in this Section.</li>
              <li>7.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Limited License Grant to Other Users of User Content</span>. By Posting User Content to or via the Service to other users of the Service or to a public area of the Service (or by sharing User Content with other users through a private communication feature on the Service), you grant those users a
                non-exclusive license to access and use that User Content as permitted by these Terms and the functionality of the Service. Deletion of User Content from a public area of the Services does not affect rights of Users in the copies of your User Content that other Users downloaded before deletion. Please be aware that Youpi cannot
                control what other users or third parties who have access to such content do with such content once they have been exposed to it, so you should use common sense and good judgement in the decisions you make regarding what content to post to or through the Service.</li>
              <li>7.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Specific Rules for Photographs and Images</span>. If you Post a photograph or image to the Service that includes one or more persons, you hereby grant such persons and their administrators, guardians, heirs, and trustees, if any, an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free, fully paid-up, worldwide
                license to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display that photograph for personal use and through any online platform or service, including the Service, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, but not to promote any third-party product, good, or service. The license contained in this Section does not permit the subject of any
                photo or their administrators, guardians, heirs, or trustees to sell that image or photograph, whether on a standalone basis or as embodied in any product.</li>
              <li>7.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">You Must Have Rights to the Content You Post; User Content Representations and Warranties</span>. You must not Post User Content if you are not the owner of or are not fully authorized to grant rights in all of the elements of that User Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content
                and the consequences of providing User Content via the Service. By providing User Content via the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:</li>
                 <ol class="number3" type="a">
                   <li>you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Youpi and users of the Service to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by Youpi, the Service,
                     and these Terms; </li>
                    <li>your User Content, and the Posting or other use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, misappropriate, or otherwise breach any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or
                      any other intellectual property, contract, or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Youpi to violate any law or regulation or require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation
                      or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and</li>
                    <li>your User Content could not be deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, violent, or otherwise inappropriate.</li>
                </ol>
              <li>7.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">User Content Disclaimer</span>. We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users Post, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. Youpi may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our
                sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy
                you have or may have against Youpi with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice.
                For clarity, Youpi does not permit infringing activities on the Service.</li>
              <li>7.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Monitoring Content</span>. Youpi does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User Content; (b) any content made available by third parties; or (c) the use of the Service by its users. You acknowledge and agree that Youpi reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and
                all information transmitted or received through the Service for operational and other purposes. If at any time Youpi chooses to monitor the content, Youpi still assumes no responsibility or liability for content or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of content. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded,
                copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy. </li>

These messages may include verification codes, operational messages about your use of the Service or other information. You may opt out of receiving marketing text messages at
                     any time by sending an email to help@youpi.camera indicating that you no longer wish to receive marketing texts along with the phone number of the mobile device receiving the texts. You may continue to receive text messages for a short period while we process your request, and you may also receive text messages confirming the receipt
                     of your opt-out request. Operational text messages are essential to the Service. If you do not wish to receive operational text messages from us, do not use the Service.

            <ol class="number2">
              <li>16.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Generally</span>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Youpi in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 16.2 and 16.3, you and Youpi agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND YOUPI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</li>
              <li>16.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Exceptions</span>. Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</li>
              <li>16.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Opt-Out</span>. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 16 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Youpi, Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 112 Alley Way, Mountain View, CA 94040 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“<span class="bold">Opt-Out Notice</span>”). Once Youpi receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 16 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 17.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. </li>
              <li>16.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Arbitrator</span>. Any arbitration between you and Youpi will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<span class="bold">AAA</span>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “<span class="bold">AAA Rules</span>”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Youpi. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</li>
              <li>16.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Notice of Arbitration; Process</span>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<span class="bold">Notice of Arbitration</span>”). Youpi’s address for Notice is: Youpi, 112 Alley Way, Mountain View, CA 94040. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<span class="bold">Demand</span>”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Youpi may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Youpi must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Youpi in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Youpi will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.</li>
              <li>16.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Fees</span>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Youpi will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the county and state of your residence or billing address, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence or billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Youpi for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</li>
              <li>16.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">No Class Actions</span>. YOU AND YOUPI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Youpi agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
              <li>16.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</span>. If Youpi makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Youpi’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Youpi’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Youpi will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</li>
              <li>16.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="underline">Enforceability</span>. If Section 16.7 or the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, or if Youpi receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null and void and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</li>
